This library is in no mean intended to be a silver bullet for any screen, but just provides a simplification when writing a new app from scratch. It's still a work in progress, so there's no documentation or sample yet.

## Usage

### Gradle

```groovy
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
    dependencies {
        testCompile 'com.github.xgouchet:ArchX:0.1'
    }
```

## Donate

This library is completely free to use. I try my best to make it as good as possible, but only do this on my free time. If you want to support my work, you can click the Donate button below.
